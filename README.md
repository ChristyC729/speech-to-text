# Subtitle & Transcriptions
In this project, implementing different forms of speech-to-text methods. The two methods I used are split into two folders above:
- Subtitles: Displaying given text to match audio in a video format
- Transcription: Given an audio file, translating the file into a text format


## Subtitles
Under the subtitles folder, you will find a simple website with a sample `.mp4` file. The version I have here takes in `.vtt` caption folder to create both captions (direct audio) and subtitles (translated audio). For a more detailed description of the subtitles projects, there is a separate README in the folder.
### Stack
- React.js

## Transcriptions
Under the transcription folder, you will find 2 different implementations of speech-to-text written in Python. For a more detailed description of the transcription projects, there is a separate README in the folder.
### Stack
- Python
- AssemblyAI API

## Future Work
For transcription, adding an option for real time translation from audio to text, allowing microphone access.

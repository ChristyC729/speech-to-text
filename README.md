# Subtitle & Transcriptions
Implementing different forms of speech-to-text methods

## Subtitles
Under the subtitles folder, you will find a simple website with a sample `.mp4` file. The version I have here takes in `.vtt` caption folder to create both captions (direct audio) and subtitles (translated audio)

## Transcriptions
Under the transcription folder, you will find 2 different implementations of speech-to-text written in Python.

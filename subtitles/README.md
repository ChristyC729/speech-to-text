# Subtitles

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## To Run:

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

this will display a simple local webpage with a stock `.mp4` video. The subtitles are generated using `.vtt` format files. All files used in this implementation can be found in the ['Subs' Folder](/subtitles/src/subs/).
